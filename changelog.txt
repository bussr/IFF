1/29/11:
* Changed the Object class to Picture to disambiguate it from python's built-in Object class and to avoid confusion
* Added documentation to both the main and picture files

2/7/11:
* Changed default timeout to Incorrect Answer (instead of default Friend)
* Reduced the amount of time between trials from 3.2 seconds to 2.2 seconds
* If the subject responds before the first cue, then display a warning message, delay for 5 seconds, and restart the trial
* Extended end of block feedback to include:
    -how many friends shot
    -how many times you were shot
    -how many enemies let into the base
* Provided input after RIN for whether the enemy shoots first or not and which enemy/friend item distribution to use
    -"0 or 1" is asking whether you want the enemy to shoot first on the trials. 0 for no, 1 for yes
    -"1 to 8" is asking which of the 8 combinations of friend/enemy cues you want to use
* Added an "experiment complete" screen to the end of the experiment
* Added art and implementation for additional soldiers

2/9/11:
* Added SOLDIERTYPES flag to config file to indicate whether more than one soldier should be used
* Swapped out the backpack for the bucket
* Took out "Try to respond faster." from the enemy shoots message
* Changed "RIN" prompt to "Subject Number"
* Changed "0 or 1" to "a or b": "a" the enemy does not shoot early, "b" he does
* Added subject number, enemy shoot early condition, and item configuration information to log title
* Changed early reply message
* Added space bar to continue between data entry and trials starting
* Changed block results message

2/18/11:
* Fixed multiple input at once bug. If both friend and enemy keys are pressed at the same time, only the friend key will be processed now.

2/20-something/11:
* pycogworks integration

3/1/11:
* Removed the inputbox class.
* Determines condition based on args.condition instead of an inputbox.
* If no args are provided, always does enemy shoots first and randomly picks a set of enemy/friend items
* Added a junk subject number of -99 if not connected to cogworld

3/11/11:
* Added log_event helper function to consolidate writing log files whether cogworld is present or not
* Everything runs at 120 fps as opposed to 500 now. This is also a changeable value FPS in config.txt now
* Added wait_for_space helper function to save lines of code
* Added sleep detection if the player doesn't input anything for ASLEEP (in config) consecutive trials that go the full length
    The keys for getting out of sleep mode are q+p. The next trial will begin after a 2-second delay
* Feedback now shows soldier with all items present
* Trials are now all capped at TRIALTIME milliseconds (changeable in config.txt)

3/21/11:
* Added a tutorial block which can be switched on or off in config.txt by USE_TUTORIAL.
NOTE: I didn't bother adjusting the logging for the tutorial block since I figure it'll be ignored anyway.
* Changed the number of blocks from 8 to 6.

3/23/11:
* Fixed a bug in sleep detection that caused it to only detect sleep once per experiment.

4/8/11:
* Changed total trial time from 8 seconds to 7.
* Added two more spoof trials.
* Space bar is now required between spoof trials
* Added colors to spoof words to make them stand out even more
* Correct identifications are rewarded with a shorter trial (as defined by REWARDTIME in config.txt)
* Added new variables FRIENDBUTTON and ENEMYBUTTON to config.txt to more easily change which buttons to use for input
* Added accept_input function to save space and make it easier to use in the tutorial block
* Fixed a bug in accuracy ratio feedback
* Renamed "tutorial" to "spoof" to avoid confusion
* Added USE_TRAINING variable to config.txt and implemented training block
* Quitting while waiting for the space bar is now allowed
* Quitting while waiting for the experimenter is now allowed
* Fixed a bug that was causing the friend or enemy status of the soldier to be calculated incorrectly

4/10/11:
* Added the following boolean variables: SHOOTFIRSTFRIEND, NOSHOOTENEMY, NOSHOOTFRIEND.
    A value of "True" means that the trial will timeout in that case, otherwise it will wait for input.
* Added a PUNISHMENTTIME variable to establish a minimum time for how long the subject must wait after an incorrect identification.
    This is useful for conditions where the subject is given as much time as they please to make a choice
* Added a SHOOTFIRST variable to config.txt to more easily test the two conditions. This is overridden when a condition is provided

4/18/11:
* Fixed logging of identifying as enemy

4/19/11:
* Added messages indicating friend or enemy soldier for training block
